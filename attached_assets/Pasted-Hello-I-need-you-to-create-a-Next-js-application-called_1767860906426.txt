Hello! I need you to create a Next.js application called "AirAware". Please follow these instructions carefully to ensure the structure and functionality are correct.

1. Tech Stack

The application must use the following technologies:

Framework: Next.js with the App Router.
Language: TypeScript.
Styling: Tailwind CSS, configured for a dark theme by default.
UI Components: ShadCN UI. Please use the following components: Card, Button, Input, Label, Select, Dialog, Sheet, Avatar, Toast, Accordion, Tabs, and Skeleton.
Icons: lucide-react.
Charts: recharts.
AI Integration: Genkit for connecting to the Gemini model.
Dependencies: also include class-variance-authority, clsx, tailwind-merge, tailwindcss-animate, react-markdown.
2. Project Structure & File Content

Please create the following file structure and use the exact code provided for each file.

Root Files:

next.config.ts
tailwind.config.ts
postcss.config.js
components.json (for ShadCN)
package.json (listing all dependencies from the tech stack)

ShadCN UI Files (/src/components/ui):

Please generate all the ShadCN UI component files as per the list in the tech stack.
3. Core Functionality to Implement

Authentication: A simple, non-secure login system that stores user info (name) in localStorage. The app should be wrapped in an AuthGuard that shows a LoginPage if the user is not "logged in".
Data Fetching: The AppContext should manage fetching data from the /api/aqi route when a city is selected. It should handle loading states.
State Management: Use a React Context (AppContext) to manage global state like the selected city, user information, and health profile settings.
Routing: The app should have a sidebar for navigation on desktop and a bottom navigation bar on mobile.
AI Assistant: Implement a floating action button that opens a chat sheet. The chat should use Genkit and the Gemini model to answer user questions based on the current AQI data and the user's health profile.
Please proceed by creating the files with their corresponding content, starting with the configuration files (package.json, tailwind.config.ts, etc.) and then building out the application structure. Thank you!
